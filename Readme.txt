WHAT IS WOMPUS:
	Welcome to Wompus, a simple Board game that you most of you will find 
	enjoyable.

	HOW TO PLAY :
	- You have to make use of the four arrow keys on the keyboard
	  This allows you to move the balls around.
	- You have to find a way out, to make the green ball reach home

	If you have questions or serious problems, please contact the author
	A small collection of questions is also discussed in the FAQ section
	of the in this document.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION:
	-Unzip the game files to a directory of your choice. 
	-Click wompus.exe to play the game.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FAQ: 
-----	Why is the color scheme so wierd ?
	Please remember that this version of the game was written in Visual Basic 1,
	and has been ported almost verbatim to Visual Basic 6
	The game was written about 10 years back at a time when most of us had 
	black/white monitors.Most of the color combinations were selected to get 
	good contrast. The original color schemes have been retained.

-----	The coding seems rather simplistic/wierd in places ?
	Well it has been done with Visual Basic 1. I have not changed the code when 
	I ported it to Visual Basic 6 (This game shoud run on all versions of Visual
	Basic, but I have not personally tested it)

	Most features that we are now used to simply did not exist at that time. 
	- There was noting like vbCrLf. We had to use Chr$(13) & Chr$(10)
	- KeyPreview property never existed.
	- Option Explicit - most of us never needed it
	- Variable Declaration - we used $, % and #
	- Hungarian naming conventions - Whats that ?
	
	Strange. But those were the days.
	If I were to do this game again, I may do it differently. I may 
	have several optimisations,sound effects, cool looks.

-----	There is no sound ?
	Not surprising. Sound cards were rare and costly, at the time this 
	game was coded.

-----	Where can I get a new version ?
	As of June 2004, there is no new version yet. Let's see.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT:
	If you make modifications to source code and distribute the compiled version, 
	be sure to obey the GPL license. You should include the sourcecode, or make
	it availible for download together with the binary version.
